<h1>The Online Version of the Addictive Marbles Game</h1>

<p>The online computer version plays with the same rules as the original board game.  There are few points to note when playing online:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The minimum requirements to run the online game is a either a Windows 10 or Mac computer that has at least a 13 inch screen and a web browser that supports HTML5.  This can be any recent version (since 2014) of Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer (version 9 or later), Edge or Safari.  The game will also run on iPad's with at least 10 inch screens and retina display but the drag and drop using a touchpad can be a bit more challenging.</li>
	
	<li>In order to play the game on the wshockey.ca website, you will need a user account.  Please contact me at wmshockey@gmail.com to get an account and a user name</li>
	
	<li>Playing a card and moving a marble on the board is done using the standard drag and drop operation done with a mouse or trackpad on your computer</li>
	
	<li>The computer handles all the card shuffling and card dealing.  It also handles randomly selecting which person plays first.  So there is no need for the dice in the game.</li>
	
	<li>When "killing" another marble you put your marble on top of the marble to be "killed" and the computer will automatically place the killed marble back into it's starting row.  You cannot manually move a marble into it's starting row.  So if killing multiple marbles with a 7 card, you have to land on each marble to be killed to send them back to their starting row.</li>
	
	<li>When playing a Jack, you place your marble on top of the marble you want to swap with and the computer will automatically move the displaced marble to the proper spot.</li>
	
	<li>The computer will check all moves to make sure they are valid moves.  If not, the board will be reset to the start of your move and you will be asked to take your over again.</li>
	
	<li>If it is your turn to play, a green "Start Turn" button will appear at the bottom of the board on the left hand side.  You must click on this start button first before you can play a card or move a marble.  When you have finished your turn, you click on the red button "End Turn".  If your move was valid, the play will be turned over to the next player and you will see a "waiting for..." message appear on the bottom of the board.</li>
	
	<li>If you can't make a play, just press the red "End Turn" button without playing a card or moving a marble.  You will be asked to confirmt that you are unable to play.  In this case a "Can't Play" label will appear next to your name on the board and the other players will proceed to take their turns until the hand is fully played.</li>
	
	<li>Just as with the board game, you should play your card first and then move your marble.</li>
	
	<li>Your card hand will initially appear in the centre of the board, just below the centre hole.  If you have enough screen space and want to move it elsewhere to the side of the board you can do so.  It must be your turn in order to do it though.  Behind the card hand is an image of a hand.  With 5 cards in the hand, it is hard to see but the wrist of the hand is just visible below the card in the centre of the hand.  You can select that wrist to drag and drop the entire hand to another place on the side.  Otherwise if there are fewer than 5 cards in the hand, it is easy to see the image of the hand and drag and drop it to another spot.</li>
	
	<li>The white numbers shown below each players names on the board, are the number of cards left in their hand.  Similarly, the numbers shown below the discard pile and deck are the number cards left in those piles.  The total of all those numbers will always equal 56, the total number of cards in the deck.</li>
	
	<li>To initially create a game, you click on the "New Game" button when viewing the list of games.  The "New Game" form will let you enter whatever name you wish to give to the game, and let you assign which users will be playing which colors in the game.  You can also play as teams.  If you enter a team name below the Yellow and Red players, they will form one team.  Similarly if you enter a team name below the Green and Blue players, they will form the other team.</li>
	
	<li>Note that if only two players are playing, they should put their names into either the Yellow or Red colors so that they play opposite each other on the board.  Also note that it is possible for one user to play more than one color but this is a different variatino of the game.</li>
	
	<li>Other than the above, the rules of the computer game are the same as the actual board game and are listed below.</li>
</ul>

<h1>The Addictive Marble Game </h1>
<h2>Object of the game:</h2>
	
<p>To get all four of your marbles and your partners marbles to the home spots. First team to do that wins.</p>

<ul>
<li>Played with a regular deck of 52 cards plus 4 jokers. </li>

<li>Throw the dice to determine who deals first. </li>

<li>Players take turns dealing all 56 cards - 5 to each player and after those are played, another 5 to each player, and after those are played 4 more to each player completing the deal. Then the player to your left deals. </li>

<li>In order to start a marble on the board you need one of the following cards: -
	<ul> 
	<li>Joker (or use it to move 15 spaces forward) - </li>
	<li>King (or use it to move 13 spaces forward) - </li>
	<li>Ace (or move 1 space forward) </li>
	</ul>

<li>You cannot jump a marble. If you land directly on it, you knock it back to start position where the player must have a Joker, King or Ace to move it out and start again. </li>

<li>Once a card is placed on the table it must be played. Unless it is not a playable card. </li>

<li>You must play each playable card. If you cannot play, throw all of your cards face up on the table and sit out of play until the next set of cards are dealt. </li>

<li>4 card: moves 4 spaces BACKWARDS only. All other cards move forward. </li>

<li>JACK : switch places - one of your playable marbles with another marble (partner or opponent). Once marbles are in a home spot they cannot be switched, moved backwards or knocked off. </li>

<li>7 card: the only card you can separate into different moves/marbles if you choose. Eg. Move 2 spaces, knock a marble off then continue on with as many moves as the 7 spots allow, or move part with one marble, part with another, etc. You MUST move 7 spaces in total. You cannot use only part of the 7. </li>

<li>All other cards move forward at face value. Queen moves 12 spots forward. </li>

<li>Center spot: you can move into this spot from any 6 hole (painted black) instead of moving one more spot on the outside. You can also use a 4 card to back into the center spot. Your marble must remain in the center for one turn (you cannot carry on and exit with a 7 card). You can exit via any black 6 spot on the board. </li>

<li>You cannot use a 4 to go backwards into the home spaces. You do not pass your entrance to the home spots. </li>

<li>Once all of your marbles have entered play, you can use your cards to move your partner's marbles as if they were your own. If one of your marbles gets knocked off, cannot continue to play your partner's marbles until you again have all of your marbles in play. </li>

</ul>
